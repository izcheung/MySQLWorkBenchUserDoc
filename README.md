#Overview of SQL WorkBench User Documentation

The readme.md should indicate to a reader who accesses your GitHub - an employer, for
example - what the instructions are about, including the methods and processes you used to
get to the final product. As we will be covering both instructions and reading on the web, and

a document that sells your skills in process and product.
