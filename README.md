#Overview of SQL WorkBench User Documentation

This documentation will guide you step-by-step through writing SQL commands using the MySQL WorkBench. 

This document provides you with instructions on how to run the most essential SQL queries so that you achieve most of what you need to know to manage your relational database.  We have done that by providing a guide for the most important MySQL queries such as:

- Creating a database
- Creating / Dropping a table
- Inserting / Deleting a record
- Creating / Dropping a join
- Creating / Dropping a trigger

How This Guide Was Created
This guide was created by two members with the use of Git, GitHub, and VS Code. As part of the assignment requirements, we used MkDocs for the layout of the webpage. The material was generated based on what we learned in COMP 2714 Relational Database Systems. For additional material that was not covered in class, we referred to the official MySQL documentation and W3Schools. 

Who Was This Guide Created For
This documentation is intended for users that are looking for a straightforward guide on how to manage a relational database using SQL. The main audience this guide was written for are:

- Beginner-level developers who needs a step-by-step guide on writing SQL commands.
- Analysts requiring SQL for conducting data processing tasks.

Style Guide
Every task within the documentation had a brief overview to give readers the context of the topic before going into the instructions. At the bottom of each section, there is a conclusion section to summarize what the reader has covered that sections. 

To aid in the readability of this guide, we subdivided each task into subheadings that achieve a subtask. Each step will be accompanied by figures to guide the reader in showing what the output should look like. 

Throughout the guide, codeblocks were used to represent code. We added the copy button to enhance the ease of use of this documentation. At certain points, we added admonitions to provided some tips and notes that would be helpful to users to prevent mistakes without disrupting the flow. To assist our readers, we have included a troubleshoot section to help users fix common mistakes. 

Thank you for your interest in our user documentation for writing MySQL queries in MySQL WorkBench. We hope this documentation was helpful for our readers.
