# Introduction

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that provides a set of commands that allow users to manage and manipulate relational databases. MySQL is a popular relational database management system that implements the SQL language. Some of the operations that a user can do include querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data from tables.
