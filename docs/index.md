# Introduction

In this user documentation, we will be using [MySQL WorkBench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/){:target="_blank"}, an integrated development environment (IDE) for MySQL to systematically guide users through the process of writing commonly-used SQL statements. Our objective is to provide a clear and concise tutorial on how to write SQL commands, equipting developers with the necessary skills to manage databases efficiently within MySQL Workbench.

## Background

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that provides a set of commands that allow users to manage and manipulate relational databases.
